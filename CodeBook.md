Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This repo contains project code for Getting and Cleaning Data course given by John Hopkins university on Coursera.

Script

The script contains a function run.analysis() that performs the actual job:

reads train and test data sets and merges them
processes the merged data set (extract the relevant variables, adds descriptive activity names, etc.)
writes the merged data set to rawdata.csv
generates the tidy data set
writes the tidy data set to tidydata.csv
returns the tidy data set
If you've a Samsung data available in the current directory, just run:

source('./run_analysis.R')
run.analysis() # invoke the actual function
Otherwise, you can use download.data() function provided in the script. The function will download the data archive and extract it. After that you can run run.analysis(). The full code:

source('./run_analysis.R')
download.data() # download samsung data and unzip it
run.analysis() # invoke the actual function
If you don't want to use download.data(), you should download the samsung data manually, unzip it in the current directory and then run:

source('./run_analysis.R')
run.analysis() # invoke the actual function
Note: In all the examples above, I assume that the script file run_analysis.R resides in the current working directory. If it does not, you should provide the correct path to the file to source it.

Data sets

Raw data set

In order to create a raw data set, the following regular expression was used: -(mean|std)[(]. I.e. all variables containing -mean( or -std( in their names were filtered.

Totally, the raw data set contains 68 variables:

subject - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
label - An activity label.
Plus 66 filtered features mined as described below.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
-XYZ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
Tidy data set

Tidy data set contains the same variables as the raw does, but the variables were renamed according to following rules:

All lower case when possible - the variables names were not converted to lower case, since it would make them unreadable. Instead, the variable names were converted to satisfy camlCase rule.
Descriptive (Diagnosis versus Dx) - the variable names are descriptive, so nothing special should be done.
Not duplicated - the variable names are unique, so again nothing special had to be done.
Not have underscores or dots or white spaces - dashes and parentheses were removed from variable names.
To satisfy the requirements above, the following replacements were performed:

Replace -mean with Mean
Replace -std with Std
Remove characters -()
Replace BodyBody with Body
